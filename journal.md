After a semester of projects with Turtle, scratch, Makecode, using blocks and snippets of text, thre is a beter sense of what thing to put in a backpack for a mountain climbing journey. 

* Fun to use, dilightful visuals
* Simple visulaization of data structures
* A glimpse of a simulated memory layout (Like HeepPeek) 
* Run everywhere, and pretty fast. JS does that well. Python is runner up. SVG and Canvas well defined and optimized

# Spider (JS) 
A turtle that can spin webs, webs that can be crawled in many dimenstions. 


# Iniitial todo
* Todo Rules DONE
* html + JS baisc file DONE
* Spider object
* Web Object
* Button Object
* Slide Object
* A library for JS use
* A meta shell for simple inteactive lisp like programs

# TODO rules
* Simple stements (avoid compound statements like and)
* 1.0 place holders are great. Build and ooch (Credit Jeff K and Dr T., Perfection is the enemy of good, Col Mac Leod)
* Make impossible, elegant, easy beautiful. the rest will follow (Paul A)
* tell stories along the way.
